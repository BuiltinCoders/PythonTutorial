# # while loop is also a type of loop which runs the code till the condition of statement
# is true

# how to use while loop?
# we can use while loop similarly like for loop

# i = 0

# while i<51:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1                                 # 'i+=1' stands for 'i = i+1'

# we can use while loop to get the values from different collection datatype

i=0
ls = ['mohan', 'sohan', 'nitesh', 'jerry', 'tom']

while i!=len(ls):
    print(ls[i])
    i+=1
