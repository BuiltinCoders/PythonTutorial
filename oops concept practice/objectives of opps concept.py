# Objectives of OOPs Concept are as follows:

# 1. classes = Classes work as a templete in a object oriented programming
# these are also the framework for the perticular work.

# 2. Objects = These are the instance of the class.
# these are the members of the class which can use  the framework of the class for
# perticular work.

# 3. Methods = Methods are those functions which are defined in the class.

# This "OOPs" Concept are based on "DRY" concept.
# (DRY - Do Not Repeat yourself)
